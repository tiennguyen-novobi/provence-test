The display also features up to 48 percent more color than the previous generation. The display glass goes right to the edge of the screen for 50% less bezels.<\/p>\r\n<p>The integrated Touch ID sensor allows you to unlock your MacBook Air with your fingerprint and authenticate your identity. You can also make secure online purchases with Apple Pay. Paired with the Apple T2 security chip, the T2's Security Enclave protects your Touch ID information and also ensures that software loaded during the boot process has not been tampered with. The T2 also features an SSD controller with on-the-fly data encryption for everything stored on the SSD for a secure boot process.<\/p>\r\n<p>The keyboard utilizes Apple's butterfly mechanism for precise and responsive typing. Each key is individually backlit and works with an ambient light sensor for a more uniform illumination. You can also use the Force Touch trackpad, which is 20 percent larger than the previous generation, and has pressure-sensing capabilities as well as haptic feedback. The stereo speakers have also been improved to provide twice the bass and 25 percent more volume than the previous generation.<\/p>\r\n<p>Featuring a significantly smaller footprint, the MacBook Air takes up 17 percent less volume, is 10 percent thinner measuring just 0.61 inches at its thickest point, and at just 2.75 pounds is a quarter pound lighter than the previous generation. Made from a custom Apple-designed aluminum alloy, the MacBook Air was created out of 100 percent recycled aluminum. This custom aluminum alloy helps reduce the MacBook Air's carbon footprint by nearly 50 percent.<\/p>\r\n<p>The system is powered by an 8th Gen 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 dual-core processor and has 8GB of onboard 2133 MHz LPDDR3 RAM and a 256GB PCIE-based SSD. Connect to the internet via Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and use Bluetooth 4.2 to connect wirelessly to compatible peripherals and accessories. The dual Thunderbolt 3 ports provide high bandwidth of up to 40 Gb\/s and the versatility of USB Type-C.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>This Mac comes preloaded with macOS.

The frequency scan function automatically searches for the cleanest frequency at your location, while the adjustable input sensitivity on the transmitter accommodates mic levels ranging from booming voices to quiet speech, and even line-level audio.<\/p>\r\n<p>The system includes the improved ME 2-II omnidirectional lavalier mic, a bodypack transmitter, and a camera-mount receiver. It connects to a camcorder or a DSLR\/mirrorless camera to capture crisp-sounding speech or dialog for projects ranging from documentaries to wedding videos, corporate spots, and hands-free interviews.<\/p>\r\n<p>The EW 112P G4 is backward-compatible with previous evolution systems, giving you the ability to mix and match G4\/G3\/G2\/G1 receivers or bodypack, handheld, and plug-on transmitters. It is also compatible with EW 500 systems.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Built for Dependable Performance in the Field<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The EW 112P G4 features rugged, all-metal chassis well suited for extended use on location. The lightweight, compact bodypack transmitter is easy to conceal and offers rounded edges that are soft to the touch and comfortable for the talent to wear. A locking connector ensures that your lav doesn&rsquo;t detach at a critical moment, while a convenient switch allows you to mute your mic.<\/li>\r\n<li>Using the included shoemount adapter, the equally compact receiver easily mounts on your camera without adding much weight. The included cables allow you to connect the receiver to the 3.5mm or XLR audio input of any DSLR\/mirrorless, camcorder, or recording device.<\/li>\r\n<li>Both transmitter and receiver feature daylight-readable LED displays showing reception quality, battery status, and audio level. To get you going quickly, they synchronize via infrared interface with the simple push of a button.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Proven Broadcast-Quality Sound<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The EW 112P G4 ships with the popular ME 2-II omnidirectional lavalier microphone, which delivers a natural sound optimized for speech intelligibility. Its omnidirectional polar pattern ensures that the sound remains consistent, even when the speaker's head moves away from the mic.<\/li>\r\n<li>To take full advantage of the ME 2-II&rsquo;s dynamic range, the system employs proprietary HDX compander technology, preserving your sound without adding unwanted noise during transmission, and delivering audio with remarkable accuracy and quality.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Additional Features<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Adaptive-diversity reception for reliable transmission up to 330'<\/li>\r\n<li>42 MHz bandwidth with 1680 tunable UHF frequencies for clean reception<\/li>\r\n<li>20 frequency banks, each with up to 12 factory-preset channels to prevent intermodulation<\/li>\r\n<li>Pilot tone squelch for eliminating RF noise when transmitter is turned off<\/li>\r\n<li>Receiver with adjustable output range of 42 dB to match the audio input of your camera or recording device<\/li>\r\n<li>User-friendly menu operation with flexible control options<\/li>\r\n<li>Transmitter and receiver feature 4-step battery-life indicator<\/li>\r\n<li>Auto-Lock function avoids accidental changing of settings<\/li>\r\n<li>RF Mute function<\/li>\r\n<li>8 hours of battery life<\/li>\r\n<li>Powered via AA batteries or rechargeable BA 2015 Accupack batteries (available separately)<\/li>\r\n<li>Side contacts for recharging the Accupacks without removing them from either transmitter or receiver&mdash;requires the L 2015 quick-charging unit (available separately)<\/li>\r\n<li>Operate up to 12 wireless mics at once on set<\/li>\r\n<li>Unlike digital wireless systems, the SK 100 G4 transmitter can transmit to an unlimited number of EW Series receivers<\/li>\r\n<li>Wide range of accessories adapts the system to a variety of applications<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">EW 100 G4 vs EW 500 G4 Systems at a Glance<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Bandwidth: <\/strong>Up to46 MHz vs up to 88 MHz<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>UHF Frequencies: <\/strong>1680 vs up to 3520<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>RF Output Power:<\/strong> Fixed 30 mW vs adjustable 10\/30\/50 mW<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Mics at Once:<\/strong> Up to 12 mics vs up to 32 mics<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Included Lavalier Mic:<\/strong> ME 2-II omni or ME 4 cardioid vs professional MKE 2 omni<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Headphone Output:<\/strong> No vs yes<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Audio Output:<\/strong> Unbalanced vs balanced<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Plug-On Transmitter:<\/strong> No phantom vs +48V phantom power<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>",

The frequency scan function automatically searches for the cleanest frequency at your location, while the adjustable input sensitivity on the transmitter accommodates mic levels ranging from booming voices to quiet speech, and even line-level audio.<\/p>\r\n<p>The system includes the improved ME 2-II omnidirectional lavalier mic, a bodypack transmitter, and a camera-mount receiver. It connects to a camcorder or a DSLR\/mirrorless camera to capture crisp-sounding speech or dialog for projects ranging from documentaries to wedding videos, corporate spots, and hands-free interviews.<\/p>\r\n<p>The EW 112P G4 is backward-compatible with previous evolution systems, giving you the ability to mix and match G4\/G3\/G2\/G1 receivers or bodypack, handheld, and plug-on transmitters.

The lightweight, compact bodypack transmitter is easy to conceal and offers rounded edges that are soft to the touch and comfortable for the talent to wear. A locking connector ensures that your lav doesn&rsquo;t detach at a critical moment, while a convenient switch allows you to mute your mic.<\/li>\r\n<li>Using the included shoemount adapter, the equally compact receiver easily mounts on your camera without adding much weight. The included cables allow you to connect the receiver to the 3.5mm or XLR audio input of any DSLR\/mirrorless, camcorder, or recording device.<\/li>\r\n<li>Both transmitter and receiver feature daylight-readable LED displays showing reception quality, battery status, and audio level.

A fresh Apple H1 chip provides a host of user benefits including increased wireless connection stability, faster device switching times, quicker call connection times, and voice-enabled Siri access. Plus, when playing games on your device, the AirPods deliver up to 30% less latency than the previous generation. Following a single-tap setup, these AirPods automatically turn on and maintain their connection to your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac computer; forget having to manually engage or disengage power. Enjoy music, answer calls, or communicate with Siri on your mobile device without having to pull out your iPhone.<\/p>\r\nThese AirPods automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say \"Hey Siri\" to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency.\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\nAdditionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time. Just 15 minutes in the case gives you three hours of listening time or up to two hours of talk time.\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"descriptionAsTitle_LRRtSDQ8YlWH-emvPXLFQ\">\r\n<div>H1 headphone chip delivers a faster and more stable wireless connection to your devices&mdash;up to two times faster when switching between active devices, and a 1.5 times faster connection time for phone calls&mdash;plus up to 30 percent lower gaming latency<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"descriptionAsTitle_LRRtSDQ8YlWH-emvPXLFQ\">\r\n<div>Automatically on, automatically connected<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"descriptionAsTitle_LRRtSDQ8YlWH-emvPXLFQ\">\r\n<div>One-tap setup for your Apple devices<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"descriptionAsTitle_LRRtSDQ8YlWH-emvPXLFQ\">\r\n<div>Voice-enabled access to Siri<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"descriptionAsTitle_LRRtSDQ8YlWH-emvPXLFQ\">\r\n<div>More than 24-hour battery life with charging case<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"descriptionAsTitle_LRRtSDQ8YlWH-emvPXLFQ\">\r\n<div>Charge quickly in the case<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"descriptionAsTitle_LRRtSDQ8YlWH-emvPXLFQ\">\r\n<div>Rich, high-quality audio and voice<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"descriptionAsTitle_LRRtSDQ8YlWH-emvPXLFQ\">\r\n<div>Seamless switching between devices<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"descriptionAsTitle_LRRtSDQ8YlWH-emvPXLFQ\">\r\n<div>With the Wireless Charging Case (available separately), charging is as simple as placing the AirPods case on a Qi-compatible charging mat<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Compatibility<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Apple Watch, Mac, and Apple TV running the latest software<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>",

Powered by the Apple A8 chip, the HomePod delivers a wide, spacious soundstage. Using spatial awareness to sense its location in the room, the HomePod automatically adjusts the audio to sound optimal wherever it's placed. The large Apple-designed woofer delivers deep, clean bass while the custom array of seven beamforming tweeters provide pure high frequency acoustics with directional control.

It also learns preferences and tastes that are shared across devices. Using Siri to deliver deep knowledge of artists, songs, albums, and more, HomePod can handle advanced searches within Apple Music's catalog, so users can ask questions like, \"Hey Siri, when was this song released?\" or \"Hey Siri, can you play something totally different?\" to change the mood.<\/p>\r\n<p>The HomePod is more than just a wireless speaker. It has Siri built-in so you can send messages, set timers and reminders, and check the weather &mdash; all with just your voice. The latest business news, headlines, and sports updates stream directly to the HomePod from popular media sources, like NPR, CNN, ESPN, and more. HomePod can also be used as a speakerphone with the Apple iPhone for a hands-free conversation.<\/p>\r\n<p>With HomeKit support, HomePod can control multiple home devices and control a number of different accessories at the same time. HomePod can turn on the lights, raise the shades, set the desired temperature, and more. You can even enable remote access and automations for certain times of the day.<\/p>\r\n<p>The HomePod features 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 technology.

This Apple Watch features a 40mm curved watch face with an LTPO OLED Retina display and digital crown. The crown is how you navigate through watchOS 5 to view your apps and content. The crown has haptic feedback, giving each turn a mechanical click-like feel, and an integrated titanium electrode lets you use the ECG app. On the back, the Apple Watch features an optical heart sensor to quickly check your heart rate, and an electric heart sensor that works with the crown to generate an ECG (electrocardiogram).<\/p>\r\n<p>Generating your own ECG to save and share with your doctor is just one example of how the Apple Watch is designed to help you monitor your health. It can also detect and monitor your workouts, giving you essential metrics to help you reach your goals. It's water-resistant up to 164', so you can record laps on a track or in the pool. Even when not working out, the Apple Watch utilizes three activity rings to motivate you to keep moving throughout your day.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can help stay motivated during workouts by streaming your favorite music, podcasts, or invite a friend to a seven-day challenge. In a competition, you'll share your activity and compete for bragging rights and digital medals. Notifications of your friend's progress act like a personal trainer to keep you going.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 4 stays connected to the outside world via Wi-Fi or a wireless Bluetooth connection to your iPhone. When connected, you can use the watch as an extension of your phone to view text messages, interact with Siri, navigate via built-in GPS, or make handsfree calls with the integrated speaker and microphone.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Generate an ECG Anytime, Anywhere<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>The built-in titanium electrode in the digital crown and the sapphire crystal electronic heart sensor on the back of the Apple Watch gives you the ability to record your own ECG, or electrocardiogram. It's similar to a single-lead electrocardiogram and takes only 30 seconds to create. Just touch the digital crown and wait for the Apple Watch to generate your ECG waveform.<br \/><br \/>The ECG app is meant to help you detect whether you're heart's beating at a normal sinus rhythm, or if your rhythm shows signs of irregularity, or atrial fibrillation. Your ECGs are stored in the Health app on your iPhone and you can share them with your doctor.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Heart Rate Sensor<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>The optical heart sensor on the back of the Apple Watch is designed to measure and record your heart rate. Irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias), high heart rates, and low heart rates, can all be indicators of a possible underlying problem. The Apple Watch is engineered to monitor this reading and alert you to any irregularities.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Fall Detection<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>The Apple Watch Series 4 features an updated accelerometer and gyroscope that can detect whether you've fallen. If a fall occurs, the Apple Watch delivers an on-screen prompt where you can swipe to have it call emergency services or dismiss it. After 60 seconds of unresponsiveness, the Apple Watch will place the call automatically and send a message to your emergency contacts.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Emergency SOS<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>Emergency SOS allows you to quickly get help. It calls 911, notifies your emergency contacts, sends your current location, and displays your Medical ID badge on the screen for emergency personnel.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Complications<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>You can customize your watch face with multiple complications, which are little icons that are designed to activate apps or provide information. The Series 4 infograph watch face can display up to eight complications, including complications with curved progress bars and gauges.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Activity Rings<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>Three activity rings on the Apple Watch Series 4 are designed to help you measure all of the ways you move throughout the day. As you move, each ring begins to close, giving you additional motivation to close your rings and increase mobility.<br \/><br \/><strong>Move<\/strong>: The Move ring tracks the active calories you burn. Active calories are the ones you burn through all kinds of movement, from taking the stairs at work to playing with the kids.<br \/><strong>Exercise<\/strong>: The Exercise ring shows you how many minutes of brisk activity you've done, whether you're working out or just moving at a fast pace.<br \/><strong>Stand<\/strong>: Sitting too much has the potential to contribute to health problems over time. This ring is designed to keep track of the amount of times you stand throughout the day.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Workout App<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>With the Workout app, the Apple Watch Series 4 lets you track your workout progress, set individual goals, and measure your calorie burn. For runners, a cadence metric lets you see your steps per minute, and rolling miles allows you to see your split for the preceding mile at any time.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Automatic Workout Detection<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>If you start a workout, sensors within the Apple Watch will prompt you to start the Workout app. It will even give you credit for the exercise you've already started.

Using her Laptop, Cortana keeps track of your needs and wants, and she learns over time to improve her information gathering skills.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Microsoft Edge<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>After nearly 20 years, Microsoft has finally replaced its Internet Explorer web browser. With Microsoft Edge, users can write directly on web pages and share notes with friends and colleagues.

Edge also has built-in Cortana integration; you can have her help you find a restaurant, make a reservation, and pull up directions without leaving your browser.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Windows Store<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>For Windows 10, Microsoft has unified the Windows Store. Now, apps for PCs, tablets, and phones will all be accessible from one place. And with support for Universal Apps, one version of an app can work across all your compatible devices automatically.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Windows Continuum<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>Windows 10 was designed for a variety of screen sizes and input styles, and with its Continuum feature, it automatically adapts to fit your needs. A Windows 10 tablet on its own requires a touch-centric approach, but attaching a mouse and keyboard will shift everything to a more traditional interface. You can even attach an external monitor to your Windows 10 phone for a near-desktop experience. But it's not just the operating system; Windows Universal Apps take advantage of Continuum as well.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 class=\"h2_34R1Z4rcOIa8NE_99A_jkV\">Xbox on Windows 10<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"description_2ub4q6HodBZr8d45BEOdIW\">\r\n<div>Gaming is a big focus of Windows 10. Xbox integration allows for PC players to match up against Xbox One players on supported games, and if you have an Xbox One, you can even stream compatible titles to your PC. Native support for recording with the new Game DVR feature makes it easy to capture and share your gameplay. The new DirectX12 takes better advantage of multi-core processors, giving games a performance boost, even on older hardware. Windows 10 also features native support for virtual reality headsets, such as the Oculus Rift.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>",
